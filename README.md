# Antiform-Improvements
Changes many things about Antiform so it's less of a punishment and more of a proper form. Includes costing 4 drive, damage multiplier removed, No Experience ability removed, Reaction Commands usable, and persistence across rooms. Does NOT include healing or a camp menu... yet. Revert in battle by pressing R2 + L2 at the same time. Also starts you off with Anti Form in your inventory.
Special thanks to Zurph for all of the LUA work!

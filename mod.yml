title: Antiform Improvements
description: Changes many things about Antiform so it's less of a punishment and more of a proper form. Includes costing 4 drive, damage multiplier removed, No Experience ability removed, Reaction Commands usable, and persistence across rooms. Does NOT include healing or a camp menu... yet. Revert in battle by pressing R2 + L2 at the same time. Credits to Zurph for creating the LUA script.
